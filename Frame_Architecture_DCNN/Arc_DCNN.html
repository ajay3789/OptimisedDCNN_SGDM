%% Formal steps of model execution %
(a) Load LISS-IV dataset in 'imageDatastore' with carried of five catrgories land-use classes barren land, builtup area, coal mining region, vegetation, and waterbody.
(b) After that labeled all the samples in the image datastore.
(c)Divided the imagestore samples of the LISS-IV dataset into a 7:3 ratio of training and validation dataset with randomized.
(d) A DCNN framework, designed for land-use classification, consists of three layers, including  three -convolution layer (Conv_Layer),2- pooling layer (Pool_Layer), and 1-fully connected layer (FC_Layer). 
(e) Compile and train the DCNN framework Model     
 (f) Accuracy and Score of the DCNN framework Model
