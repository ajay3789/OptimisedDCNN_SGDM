The performance of the DCNN model was further examined by applying the optimizers.
The optimiser was utilised to enhance the training accuracy and minimizing loss. 
The proposed study examined the performances of the model using three optimisers including the Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADM), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSPro), and Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM)
