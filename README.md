# OptimisedDCNN_SGDM
Design of an optimized deep learning algorithm for automatic classification of high-resolution satellite dataset (LISS IV) for studying land-use patterns in a mining region
Step:1 Generated of LISS-IV satellite image land-use dataset.
Step:2 Model development of the proposed framework architecture of DCNN algorithm with the learning of samples (size: 6x6).
Step: 3 Model optimization with the tuning of hyperparameters values  and measure the  optimizer the performance of robust accuracy
Step: 4 Accuracy Assesment of model
Step:5 Study of the mining region using designed optimised DCNN+SGDM model
Step 6: Analysis for the classification of land use patterns in mining regions
